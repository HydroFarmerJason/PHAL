PHAL (Pluripotent Hardware Abstraction Layer) is a revolutionary open-source platform that transforms controlled environment agriculture into a participatory, intelligent ecosystem. Built on principles of active monism—where computational and biological systems cultivate each other—PHAL enables farmers, researchers, and communities to create resilient food production systems that learn, adapt, and thrive.

## 🌱 Quick Start

### Try the Simulator (No Hardware Required)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HydroFarmerJason/PHAL.git
cd phal
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/frontend/index.html
```

### Full Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/HydroFarmerJason/PHAL.git
cd phal

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start with Docker
docker-compose up

# Or run manually
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m phal.api
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to access the dashboard.
